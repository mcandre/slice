# slice: text sampler

slice samples random lines from your texts.

# EXAMPLE

```console
$ cd examples

$ slice romeo-and-juliet.txt
  Escalus, Prince of Verona.
  Friar John, Franciscan.
  Three Musicians.
  An Officer.
  Nurse to Juliet.
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
                                                         [Exit.]
```

# ABOUT

slice extracts random lines from text. This is useful for a variety of applications.

* Statistics
* Random name generator
* Text processing
* File previewing

For example, `head`/`tail` show only the very start and end of a document. Whereas slice shows a more representative interlace of the overall content. Akin to `less`/`more`, but in a compact, intentionally lossy form.

## Usage

By default, the preservation rate of each line is `0.1` (10%). The probability of preserving input text is evaluated once per line. In other words, different runs of the same slice command may produce different sample output _line counts_, as well as different sample line contents.

This probability can be customized with a `-rate` flag, as a value in `[0.0, 1.0]`. For example, to sample 5% of the stellar constellations:

```console
$ slice -rate 0.05 constellations.txt
Ara
Bootes
Canis
```

Alternatively, slice can deterministically skip every nth line of source text with a `-skip` flag. This disables probabalistic rate behavior.

```console
$ slice -skip 2 cities.txt
Amsterdam
Casablanca
Edison
Gallipoli
Italia
Kilogramme
Madagascar
Oslo
Quebec
Santiago
Upsala
Washington
Yokohama
```

By default, `slice` reads from stdin. See `slice -help` for more information.
